# movie theater web app
 Proof of concept (for now!) of buying ur tickets before, or at the time simply on your smart phone; this is also my tradeshow project (this year is canceled).

### TODO:
1. Request to use rust for the backend. (http://diesel.rs/)
1. Make a database and store info.
1. Cross check with the database what seats are taken for what movie.
